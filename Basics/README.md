<h1>Introduction</h1>


<h4>History</h4>

<p>
	Java was developed by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991. This team of Sun Engineers was called the Green Team. Initially, the language was called <strong>GreenTalk</strong> and had an extension <em>.gt</em> but was later renamed to <strong>Oak</strong> after an oak tree that stood outside their office. This name Oak was however found to be already trademarked by Oak Technologies. So, in 1995, the Sun Engineers had to sit down for a brainstorming session to find a new name. Several others names were suggested like <em>Silk, DNA, WebRunner</em> but ultimately <strong>Java</strong> was chosen, which was probably inspired by the fact that they were drinking a cup of Peet's Java in the session. <br/><br/>
	The language itself was first designed because of a need to create a platform-independent language that could be used to create software to be embedded in various consumer electronic devices like toasters, remote controls and set-top boxes. However, around the same time as Java was being developed, the World Wide Web was booming and the Web also demanded portable programs. This resulted in the switch of focus for Java from consumer electronics to Internet programming.
